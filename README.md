# Color Box Maker

A web app which asks the user for the input like height, width and background color of a box. Once the user provides a valid input, a box with those dimensions and properties will be created.

An error modal will be shown to the user in case of any invalid input or leaving the fields empty. The user can remove the box as well (if required) once created.
